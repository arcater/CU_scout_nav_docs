# Clarkson University Scout & Nav2 Documentation (2025)

The purpose of this site is to act as a reference for anyone looking to work with the Scout UGV and Nav2 at Clarkson University. If you are not working with Nav2 you can still consult the hardware information as needed. Feel free to fork the repo for this site if you're looking to make any updates/modifications in the future.

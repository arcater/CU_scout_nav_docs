# Pointcloud to Laserscan

[https://index.ros.org/p/pointcloud_to_laserscan/]

[https://github.com/ros-perception/pointcloud_to_laserscan]

Humble installation using apt-get:
```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-pointcloud-to-laserscan
```
## Usage

This package can be used to convert 3D pointcloud data from your LiDAR to 2D laserscan data usable by Nav2 and slam_toolbox. The sample launch files can act as a template for your custom launch file. Remap cloud_in to your LiDAR's pointcloud topic, and leave the scan output as default. Both Nav2 and slam_toolbox are expecting the laserscan data to be available in the /scan topic by default.

To visualize the scan topic in RVIZ, the reliability policy for the laserscan topic must be set to "Best Effort"

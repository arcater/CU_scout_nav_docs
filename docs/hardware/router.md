No official product page exists for this product anymore. A google search will show any listings for the router on various shopping sites.

## Access and Use Cases

Connect to the router's network and in a web browser type `192.168.8.1`. Once logged in using the very secure _password_, one can view connected devices with their IPs, modify router settings, and retrieve serial/IMEI numbers.

With no valid SIM card, the router cannot be used to access the internet when mounted to the Scout. The reason for using the router with no internet is to allow for remote desktop access to the onboard computer when working outdoors.
